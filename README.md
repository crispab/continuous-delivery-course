# Continuous Delivery Course

This repo contains, in addition to other course material, a sample java project that will be used in the 4C-based course
called "Continuous Delivery â€“ En Praktisk Introduktion" (see http://crisp.se/kurser/continuous-delivery-en-praktisk-introduktion-11-12-februari-2015).

The sample project is based on Dropwizard that looks very promising based on its simplicity is several areas as:

* Deploying - just copy the single jar file to a local/remote location and execute the jar.
* Built-in container - jetty is part of the jar file.
* Built-in REST support - jersey is part of the jar file.
* Good support for writing tests - see https://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/manual/testing.html

In addition, on-line documentation looks promising, see https://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/manual/index.html.
